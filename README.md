# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a demo of my code practices. The explanation below.

The original markup of the homepage was copied from https://tomve.gumroad.com/l/startuptemplate because of the time.
But it was adapted to use it in react with components.

## Structure

I use create react app to generate the basic configuration and the project.

### Pages

I created a pages folder where container components per page should live.
You can see a home.js and its respective home.css file for styling.
Additional page components such as product.js, checkout.js, account.js cart.js, category.js, thank-you.js should live here and import the components they need from the modules or components folder.

### Modules

Here you can create folders representing different modules of the application. In this case I used the modules per page approach. So each page should have
a corresponding folder there. The content of each page should be spplited in small components and placed in the module. Finally you can import them in the home page component.

### Components

Here live the global components. You can use them anywhere.
I put here the AppHeader and the AppFooter. But You could put here components such as. Newsletter, Logo, BaseInput, BaseDropdown, StripeForm, AppLoading, etc.

### Core

Here live the business logic and data access classes.

* Components only must render markup. Any operation they need to perform should be taken from a method exposes from the services.
* Components musn't access directly to the data. It must call a method like CarService.addItem() and wait for a response.
 
This approach help us to migrate to another UI library, such as Vue or Angular without affect the logic. We only should change the markup.

### Testing

We add a example of tests made in private projects (Vue). You can see this in /tests folder.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
